# Design System

## Usage

### React

```typescript
import XXX from "design-system";
import "design-system/style.css";
```

Use `XXX` (component/function, ...) in your code.

### Notice

It is important to include library styles as well! Otherwise loader and error view will be broken.

```typescript
import "design-system/style.css";
```
